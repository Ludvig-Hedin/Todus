## [2026-02-08] Initial Local Development Setup

### Added

- Cloned Mail-Zero repository from `staging` branch
- Set up local Docker Postgres, Redis (Valkey), and Upstash Proxy containers
- Configured `.env` and `.dev.vars` with development credentials
- Initialized database schema via `pnpm db:push`

### Fixed

- **Docker**: Changed Valkey image tag from `8.0` to `latest` (fix for image not found)
- **Twilio**: Made Twilio service optional for local development (returns mock when `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` is missing)

### Environment Files Updated

- `/apps/server/.dev.vars` - Synced with root `.env` credentials
- `docker-compose.db.yaml` - Fixed Valkey image tag

### Notes

- Twilio phone number is NOT required for local development (SMS 2FA is mocked)
- Resend API key is NOT required for local development (email sending is mocked)
- Redis uses `upstash-local-token` which matches the Docker proxy setup
