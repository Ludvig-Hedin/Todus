## [2026-03-05] Login Refinement & Email Connection Guard

### Added

- **Connection Guard**: Implemented `ConnectionWrapper` for the web app, forcing users with 0 email connections (e.g., Apple Sign-in or Email/Password) to link a provider before accessing the mail UI.
- **Backend Graceful Failure**: Updated `activeConnectionProcedure` to throw `NOT_FOUND` instead of signing the user out when no connection exists.

### Fixed

- **Login Screen (iOS)**:
  - **Apple Auth Cancellation**: Gracefully handle `ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED` and similar codes to prevent error popups when users cancel authentication.
  - **Isolated Loading States**: Split Google and Apple loading states so activity spinners only show on the pressed button.
  - **Button Spacing**: Reduced gap between Google and Apple buttons to exactly 16px (1rem).
  - **Logo Balance**: Resized the top-left logo from 32px to 24px for a more balanced aesthetic with the "Todus" wordmark.
