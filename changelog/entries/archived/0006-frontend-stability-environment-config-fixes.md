## [2026-02-27] Frontend Stability & Environment Config Fixes

### Fixed

- **App Crashes**: Resolved `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')` by adding protective optional chaining for `session?.user?.id` inside various frontend hooks and components.
- **Environment Variables**: Fixed `VITE_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` resolving to `undefined` on Cloudflare Pages (which broke Sentry and Autumn API calls) by refactoring `vite.config.ts` to properly inject explicit `process.env` definitions via `loadEnv`.
- **API Auth Errors**: Fixed `401 Unauthorized` errors on `/api/autumn/customers` cross-origin calls by passing `includeCredentials={true}` to `AutumnProvider` to ensure session cookies are sent to the backend.
