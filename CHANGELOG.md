# Project Changelog

## [2026-02-21] iOS/Mac Wrapper and Todus Branding Updates

### Added

- Added `/docs/terminal-commands.md` with end-to-end startup/build/deploy commands
- Added `/docs/share-asap.md` with fastest distribution path for friends (web + TestFlight)

### Changed

- iOS wrapper now keeps HTTP/HTTPS navigation in-app and starts at `/mail/inbox`
- iOS wrapper now uses safe area/inset behavior to reduce clipped content at top/bottom
- Added env-driven app name support:
  - `VITE_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` (web branding)
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` (iOS/macOS wrapper title/loading text)
- Updated visible branding on login/onboarding/navigation/footer/manifest from Zero to Todus in key user-facing surfaces

### Notes

- OAuth browser handoff can still happen depending on Google provider behavior; this is not Supabase-specific in this stack

## [2026-02-08] Local Development Complete ✅

### Milestone

- Successfully logged in via Google OAuth
- Viewing and reading emails works
- Ready to deploy to production

## [2026-02-08] Initial Local Development Setup

### Added

- Cloned Mail-Zero repository from `staging` branch
- Set up local Docker Postgres, Redis (Valkey), and Upstash Proxy containers
- Configured `.env` and `.dev.vars` with development credentials
- Initialized database schema via `pnpm db:push`

### Fixed

- **Docker**: Changed Valkey image tag from `8.0` to `latest` (fix for image not found)
- **Twilio**: Made Twilio service optional for local development (returns mock when `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` is missing)

### Environment Files Updated

- `/apps/server/.dev.vars` - Synced with root `.env` credentials
- `docker-compose.db.yaml` - Fixed Valkey image tag

### Notes

- Twilio phone number is NOT required for local development (SMS 2FA is mocked)
- Resend API key is NOT required for local development (email sending is mocked)
- Redis uses `upstash-local-token` which matches the Docker proxy setup
