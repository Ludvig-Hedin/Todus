# Project Changelog

## [2026-02-27] Frontend Stability & Environment Config Fixes

### Fixed

- **App Crashes**: Resolved `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')` by adding protective optional chaining for `session?.user?.id` inside various frontend hooks and components.
- **Environment Variables**: Fixed `VITE_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` resolving to `undefined` on Cloudflare Pages (which broke Sentry and Autumn API calls) by refactoring `vite.config.ts` to properly inject explicit `process.env` definitions via `loadEnv`.
- **API Auth Errors**: Fixed `401 Unauthorized` errors on `/api/autumn/customers` cross-origin calls by passing `includeCredentials={true}` to `AutumnProvider` to ensure session cookies are sent to the backend.

## [2026-02-27] tRPC Errors & UI Polishing

### Fixed

- **tRPC API**: Resolved 500 Internal Server Error in `brain.generateSummary` caused by missing Vectorize indexes (`VECTOR_GET_ERROR`) by implementing a try-catch fallback.
- **UI Warnings**: Fixed `react-resizable-panels` console warnings by strictly defining `id` and `order` properties for all `ResizablePanel` components, and restoring missing `<ResizableHandle />` elements.

## [2026-02-27] Todus Branding & SEO Finalization

### Fixed

- **Rebranding Errors**: Fixed TypeScript lint errors resulting from incomplete rename operations in `auth.ts`, `email-sequences.tsx`, and `sanitize-tip-tap-html.ts`.

### Changed

- **Global Branding**: Renamed "Zero" to "Todus" across configuration, internationalization files (*.json), static pages, and the footer.
- **Brand Assets**: Updated logo asset URLs, onboarding vide links, and the GitHub repository link to point to Todus domains.
- **Code Settings**: Refactored the signature field from `zeroSignature` to `todusSignature` on both the frontend and the database schema.
- **SEO Elements**: Updated title tags, meta descriptions, and application headers to index correctly for "Todus".

## [2026-02-27] Login UI Polishing & Web Alignment

### Added

- **Colored Google Logo**: Added `GoogleColored` (iOS) and `GoogleColor` (Web) SVG components for better brand recognition.
- **Brand Identity**: Integrated `brand-logo.png` into both iOS and Web login screens.

### Changed

- **UI Copy**: Standardized welcome messaging to "Welcome to Todus" and "Your AI agent for emails".
- **Styling**: Implemented pill-shaped (fully rounded) buttons and inputs for a more modern and premium aesthetic.
- **Theme Support**: Verified full light/dark mode support for the iOS login screen.
- **Compatibility**: Switched iOS from `expo-image` to standard `react-native` `Image` to resolve native module resolution issues.

## [2026-02-25] iOS App: WebView → Native React Native (Expo Router)

### Added

- **Full native iOS app** replacing the Cloudflare WebView wrapper with real React Native screens
- **Expo Router** file-based navigation with Gmail-style drawer, stack, and modal patterns
- **Auth**: OAuth login via Google/Microsoft with bearer token stored in iOS Keychain (expo-secure-store)
- **Mail List**: Thread list per folder (Inbox, Sent, Draft, Starred, Snoozed, Archive, Spam, Trash) via TRPC
- **Thread Detail**: Full message rendering with HTML WebView, archive/delete/spam/star actions
- **Compose**: Email composer with reply/forward mode, To/Cc/Subject/Body fields
- **Search**: Debounced search modal with live thread results
- **Settings**: Hub with General, Appearance (theme toggle), Connections, and Labels screens
- **Drawer Sidebar**: Folder navigation + logout with session clearing
- **Offline caching**: AsyncStorage-backed React Query persistence

### Architecture

- `apps/ios/app/` — Expo Router file-based routes (auth, mail, settings, compose, search)
- `apps/ios/src/` — Providers (TRPC, React Query, Jotai), features (mail, auth, compose), shared (theme, state, storage)
- Ported ~80% of code from `apps/native/` (React Navigation) and adapted for Expo Router
- TypeScript strict mode with zero app-level type errors

### Files Created (~40 new files)

- Config: `babel.config.js`, `metro.config.js`, updated `package.json`, `app.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`
- Shared: `env.ts`, `secure-storage.ts`, `session.ts`, `ThemeContext.tsx`, `icons.tsx`
- Providers: `AppProviders.tsx`, `QueryTrpcProvider.tsx`, `SessionBootstrap.tsx`
- Auth: `native-auth.ts`, `login.tsx`, `web-auth.tsx`
- Mail: `[folder].tsx`, `thread/[threadId].tsx`, `ThreadListItem.tsx`, `MessageCard.tsx`, `MailSidebar.tsx`
- Compose: `compose.tsx`
- Search: `search.tsx`
- Settings: `_layout.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `general.tsx`, `appearance.tsx`, `connections.tsx`, `labels.tsx`

## [2026-02-21] iOS/Mac Wrapper and Todus Branding Updates

### Added

- Added `/docs/terminal-commands.md` with end-to-end startup/build/deploy commands
- Added `/docs/share-asap.md` with fastest distribution path for friends (web + TestFlight)

### Changed

- iOS wrapper now keeps HTTP/HTTPS navigation in-app and starts at `/mail/inbox`
- iOS wrapper now uses safe area/inset behavior to reduce clipped content at top/bottom
- Added env-driven app name support:
  - `VITE_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` (web branding)
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` (iOS/macOS wrapper title/loading text)
- Updated visible branding on login/onboarding/navigation/footer/manifest from Zero to Todus in key user-facing surfaces

### Notes

- OAuth browser handoff can still happen depending on Google provider behavior; this is not Supabase-specific in this stack

## [2026-02-08] Local Development Complete ✅

### Milestone

- Successfully logged in via Google OAuth
- Viewing and reading emails works
- Ready to deploy to production

---

## [2026-02-08] Initial Local Development Setup

### Added

- Cloned Mail-Zero repository from `staging` branch
- Set up local Docker Postgres, Redis (Valkey), and Upstash Proxy containers
- Configured `.env` and `.dev.vars` with development credentials
- Initialized database schema via `pnpm db:push`

### Fixed

- **Docker**: Changed Valkey image tag from `8.0` to `latest` (fix for image not found)
- **Twilio**: Made Twilio service optional for local development (returns mock when `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` is missing)

### Environment Files Updated

- `/apps/server/.dev.vars` - Synced with root `.env` credentials
- `docker-compose.db.yaml` - Fixed Valkey image tag

### Notes

- Twilio phone number is NOT required for local development (SMS 2FA is mocked)
- Resend API key is NOT required for local development (email sending is mocked)
- Redis uses `upstash-local-token` which matches the Docker proxy setup

[2026-02-21] [Feature] Integrated real TRPC data for the native Thread list (N3-05) via useQuery hook on MailFolderScreen and ThreadListItem (apps/native/src/features/mail/*).
